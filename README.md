# ASM_utils
A collection of macro for linux syscall and utils in assembly

# USE IT
**step 1 :**
compile with make , (If you want to use the prova.asm program)

if you are using a x86_64 processor you can use this

```$ make 8064```

if you are using a 80386 processor you can use this

```$ make i386```

Include the ASM_utils library with this istruction :

```%include "Utils.asm"```


# Work In Progress
I, am currently writing this library.

There is a small example program called prova.asm

# Attention
Is better to save Utils.asm with .mac extension, but temporally I, use .asm
